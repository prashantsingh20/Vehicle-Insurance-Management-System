# Vehicle-Insurance-Management-System

Online shopping system is a system which is developed to improve the services of customers and vendors. The main features of this project is high accuracy, design
flexibility and easy availability. This application allows customers to shop and buy the items online.

The online shopping system presents an online display of an order cut off time and an associated delivery window for items selected by the customer. The system accepts the customer's submission of a purchase order for the item in response to a time ofsubmission being before the order cut off time. The online shopping system does not
settle with a credit supplier of the customer until the item selected by the customer is picked from inventory but before it is delivered. Therefore, the customer can go online and make changes to the order. In addition, available service windows are presented to the customer as a function of customer selected order and service types and further, the order picking is assigned in accordance with a picker's preference.


In this project, when customers orders goods, our shopping system provide a virtual shopping cart for holding items selected for purchase. Successive items selected for purchase are placed into the virtual shopping cart until a customer completes their shopping trip. Virtual shopping carts may be examined at any time, and their contents can be edited or deleted at the option of the customer. Once the customer decides tosubmit a purchase order, the customer may print the contents of the virtual shopping basket in order to obtain a hard copy record of the transaction.
